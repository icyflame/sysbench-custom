#+TITLE: Sysbench Fork
#+SUBTITLE: A fork of sysbench with some custom benchmarks

This is my fork of Sysbench with some custom benchmarks, which are useful to test the performance of
write-only transactions with 2 UPDATE queries in each transaction.

The diff between sysbench's default branch and this repository can be seen [[https://github.com/akopytov/sysbench/compare/master...icyflame:sysbench-custom:custom-benchmarks][here.]]
